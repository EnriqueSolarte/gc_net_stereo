**gc_net_stereo** is the implementation according to paper: **End-to-End Learning of Geometry and Context for Deep Stereo Regression** which can be found in https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04309 

The final effect is not very good. The training process should be corrected but I don't know where goes wrong for now. This network can be trained and loss can decline but not stable.
